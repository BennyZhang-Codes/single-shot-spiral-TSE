# single-shot-spiral-TSE
MatLab code to create single shot spiral TSE sequences to be run using the Pulseq sequence programming environment (s. https://pulseq.github.io/).
The sequence allows to create all the different options described in 
Hennig J, Barghoorn A, Zhang S, Zaitsev M (2022) Single shot spiral TSE with annulated segmentation. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 88:651â€“662.
Type 'help mySpiralTSE.m' to get info about the execution parameters.

Note: if this is run with older Pulseq-releases, it may create warnings during sequence creation
